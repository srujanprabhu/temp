## Theme of the Project
Enhancing Flight Navigation Mechanism for Optimal Route Planning and Risk Mitigation

We created an User Friendly prototype which is helpful in terms of AirBus Control System. We designed, developed, and implemented a robust software solution that leverages existing algorithms to identify optimal flight paths. 
Excecute the prototype in terminal by typing the command - streamlit run main.py
